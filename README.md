This mobile app provides us with basic functionality of a checkout cart. You can add and remove items (either custom or given) from your cart. Change the quantities of any items. You can add or remove a discount from the item. You can view your total and place your order.    
The apk has been provided for testing purposes with a video link - [Coming Soon].
